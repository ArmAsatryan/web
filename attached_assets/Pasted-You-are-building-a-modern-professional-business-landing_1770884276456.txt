You are building a modern, professional business landing website for BALLISTiQ.

REFERENCE:
- Use https://ballistiq.xyz as the source of truth for structure/sections and base messaging.
- Do NOT copy the old layout. Redesign it with a premium, modern SaaS/defense-tech style.

TECH STACK (do this exactly):
- React + Vite + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- No heavy UI libraries. Keep it fast and clean.
- Single-page site with anchored sections and smooth scroll.

ASSETS:
- I will upload: logo (or use HTML logo), product screenshots, team member images, icons (Apple/Google), and optional background images.
- Put all assets in /public/assets and reference them via absolute paths like /assets/filename.png.
- If an asset is missing, render a tasteful placeholder (don’t break the layout).

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Use Google Font “Jura” for the whole site.
- Tailwind config must set fontFamily.sans = ["Jura", "system-ui", "sans-serif"].
- Use strong hierarchy: big hero title, clean section headings, readable body text.

LOGO (use this exact idea):
- Create a <Logo /> component that renders:
  <div class="font-bold tracking-wider">
    <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">BALLIST</span>
    <span style="color: rgb(0, 151, 178);">i</span>
    <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Q</span>
  </div>
- Make the logo responsive and crisp (use Jura).

COLOR PALETTE (use consistent tokens):
- Background: very dark (near black)
- Text: white + muted gray for secondary
- Primary accent: rgb(0,151,178)  (same as the “i” in the logo)
- CTA accent: a vivid green for “Get it now” style buttons (close to #13CE66 vibe)
- Cards: slightly lighter than background
- Borders: subtle, low-contrast
Implement these as CSS variables in src/index.css, then map them to Tailwind using arbitrary values or utility classes.

STYLE DIRECTION:
- Professional business / high-trust / modern product vibe.
- Subtle gradients, soft shadows, clean cards, generous spacing.
- Rounded corners (16–24px).
- Mobile-first responsive. Must look excellent on phones.

PAGE STRUCTURE (match sections from the reference site, but redesigned):
1) Sticky top navbar:
   - Left: Logo
   - Right: links (Download, Features, Prices, For Business, Reviews, Team, Contacts)
   - Smooth scroll to sections, highlight active section on scroll.
   - Mobile hamburger menu.

2) HERO section:
   - Title: “Your Shooter Assistant”
   - Short subtitle: ballistic calculator + ammo database + advanced tools.
   - Primary CTA buttons:
     - App Store (with icon)
     - Google Play (with icon)
     - Secondary link/button: “Download User Manual”
   - Hero visual: product screenshot mock (use uploaded screenshot).

3) FEATURES section:
   - 3–6 feature cards (use content based on ballistiq.xyz):
     - BALLISTiQ PRO (mini-apps)
     - Ammo database
     - Ballistic Calculator
     - Reticle database
     - Kestrel integration
   - Each card includes icon + short description.

4) PRICING / “Choose Your Version” section:
   - Two pricing cards:
     - BALLISTiQ (Free)
     - BALLISTiQ PRO (Beta) (Still Free)
   - Show included features with checkmarks.
   - CTA buttons for each.
   - Add a small note: “Pro is currently in beta” (tasteful, non-intrusive).

5) FOR BUSINESS & INTEGRATION (B2B) section:
   - Heading: “BALLISTiQ B2B”
   - Subtext: integrate the BALLISTiQ C++ Module into thermal scopes, UGVs, smart optics, and defense systems.
   - 3 solution cards with images:
     - C++ Engine for Thermal Scopes
     - C++ Engine for Ground Drones (UGV)
     - C++ Engine for Smart Turrets
   - CTA: “Contact Us for B2B” opens a modal (or scrolls to contact form).
   - Include a small “Works online or fully offline (embedded)” line (short, technical, confident).

6) REVIEWS section:
   - Pull 3–6 reviews (use what’s on the reference site as base content).
   - Display as clean testimonial cards with name/handle and rating stars.

7) TEAM section:
   - Grid of team members with photo + name + role:
     - Gerasim Israyelyan — Co-Founder & CTO
     - Spartak Kyureghyan — Co-Founder & CFO
     - Ishkhan Gevorgyan — Co-Founder & CPO
     - Armen Asatryan — Co-Founder & CEO
   - Use uploaded images. If missing, fallback to initials avatar.

8) CONTACTS section:
   - Contact card with:
     - Email (mailto)
     - Social icons: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram, LinkedIn
   - Add a simple contact form (name, email, message) that opens a mailto: link (no backend).

9) FOOTER:
   - Minimal: copyright + “Made with ❤️ by BALLISTiQ”
   - Also include quick links and small legal note placeholder (Privacy Policy / Terms) even if pages are not built yet.

ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS:
- Clean component structure:
  - src/components: Navbar, Logo, Button, Section, FeatureCard, PricingCard, TestimonialCard, TeamCard, ContactForm, Footer
- Use a data file:
  - src/data/siteContent.ts for features/pricing/reviews/team to keep content editable.
- Performance:
  - Images should have width/height or aspect ratio set.
  - Lazy-load below-the-fold images.
- Accessibility:
  - Semantic headings, aria-labels for icons, focus states for buttons/links.
- SEO:
  - Proper <title>, meta description, OpenGraph basics, favicon placeholder.

DELIVERABLE:
- A fully working Replit project that runs with one command.
- Make it look polished and production-ready.
