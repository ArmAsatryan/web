WOW EFFECTS (must implement, keep it elegant and fast):
Goal: premium “precision / high-tech” vibe (not flashy). Every effect must feel intentional.

1) HERO “Living Background” (lightweight):
- Create a subtle animated background using pure CSS (no heavy libs):
  - A slow-moving radial gradient + faint grid + soft noise overlay.
  - Add 2–3 blurred “glow orbs” (teal + green) with very slow animation (30–60s loop).
- Add a thin “trajectory line” SVG behind the hero content (curved line with 2–3 glowing nodes).
- Respect reduced motion: if prefers-reduced-motion => disable all animations.

2) Scroll reveal animations (Framer Motion allowed, minimal use):
- Install framer-motion and animate sections on first view:
  - Fade + small upward slide (8–16px), 0.4–0.6s, spring or easeOut.
- Stagger cards (features/pricing/testimonials/team) slightly for depth.
- Do not animate everything at once. Only first-time entering viewport.

3) Interactive product mockup tilt (CSS only):
- Hero screenshot card should have a gentle 3D tilt on mouse move (subtle).
- Add a soft “glass” reflection (pseudo-element) moving slightly with cursor.
- On mobile: disable tilt, keep a static premium look.

4) “Magnetic” CTA buttons (microinteraction):
- Primary CTA button slightly follows cursor (max 6–10px) on desktop.
- On hover: glow border + subtle scale (1.02), crisp shadow.
- On focus: strong accessible outline.

5) Scroll progress “precision indicator”:
- Add a small vertical progress indicator on the right side (desktop only):
  - Thin line + nodes for each section (Hero/Features/Pricing/B2B/Reviews/Team/Contact).
  - Active node glows teal; click node scrolls to section.
- Hide on mobile.

6) Numbers that feel real (no fake stats):
- Create a “Key Metrics” mini-strip (3 items) under hero:
  - Use content pulled from siteContent.ts and write “update later” placeholders if unsure.
  - Animate counting up only when visible (IntersectionObserver), but keep subtle.
  - Example labels: “Users”, “Languages”, “Countries” (values must be editable).

7) Premium “glass cards” system:
- All cards use consistent style:
  - Slight translucent background, 1px low-contrast border, soft shadow.
  - On hover: border becomes slightly brighter + tiny lift (translateY -2).
- Keep contrast readable (WCAG-ish).

8) Easter-egg level polish (small but wow):
- Add a custom cursor accent only on desktop (tiny teal dot) OR skip if it feels too much.
- Add a “Copy email” button in Contacts with a success toast.
- Add smooth anchor scroll + active nav highlight + section snapping feel (but no scroll-jank).

Performance constraints:
- Lighthouse-friendly: no huge animations, no heavy particle libraries by default.
- Use requestAnimationFrame only when needed; throttle mousemove handlers.
- Lazy-load below-the-fold images.
- All effects must be disabled or reduced under prefers-reduced-motion.

Deliverable requirements:
- Implement these effects as reusable utilities:
  - useInViewAnimation hook
  - useMagneticButton hook
  - useTiltCard hook
  - ScrollProgress component
- Keep code clean and documented.
